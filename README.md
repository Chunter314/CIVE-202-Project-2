The goal of this project is to convert an existing concrete mix design model from Excel into Python. The Client wants the group to reproduce and automate the calculations that are done in the mid design excel worksheet file in Python, so that the user is able to input material proportions and receive the final weight chart that is easily understandable and applicable. The four tasks that the client wants the group to achieve are to translate the Excel logic into Python, implement sequential user inputs, generate a final mix design output, and finally prepare and evaluate four concrete mix scenarios in order to verify the code and calculations.

In order to use the code the user will need to run the block with the inputs. The program will then ask the inputs sequentially for the user to type in. After that is done the program will output the weight chart.
